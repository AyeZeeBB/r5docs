Getting this Engine Error means you might have missed some files while extracting [detours\_r5](https://github.com/Mauler125/detours_r5/releases).

Make sure you get the `.zip` file from the release page:

![vx.x.x-beta.zip means the newest release available.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2817%29.png)

Afterwards, completely make sure you've selected all of the folders and files includes in that archive:

Extract everything into the main directory of the game, where `r5apex.exe` is.   
If you are completely sure you followed the steps correctly but the problem still persists, feel free to ask in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/R5Reloaded) in the `#questions` channel.
