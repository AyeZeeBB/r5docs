# 0xc0000142 Application error

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2811%29.png)

This Application Error is caused by not following instructions properly and doing the modifications on the S10 Build.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**NEVER MODIFY AND START YOUR UP TO DATE BUILD THAT YOU USE TO PLAY THE NORMAL GAME. ONLY USE IT ON THE SEASON 3 BUILD.**
{% endhint %}

Make sure you delete your current main installation of Apex Legends from steam/origin, and reinstall the whole game. 

Follow the instructions properly, and extract your S3 build in a different place than your main installation.
