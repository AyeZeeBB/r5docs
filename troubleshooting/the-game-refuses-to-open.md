# The game refuses to open

If you installed everything correctly but the game never opens \(for example, the command prompt freezes or shuts down instantly\), the steps here should help you.

Download/Open [Origin](https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/download) and log in.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Just to be safe, **remember** to make an alt account and run R5Reloaded **ONLY** with your alt.  
Use a _legit email_ \(like gmail\), not a temp mail.   
Origin will quickly ban your account if it detects you've used a temp mail.
{% endhint %}

After you log in, you need to add Apex Legends to your library:

Once you do that, it's recommended to disable auto-updates.   
To do so go to `Origin->Application Settings`.

Find the `Client update` section, and disable `Automatic game updates`.

After you are done with everything, leave origin in the background and open the game with `Run R5 Reloaded.exe`. 

If for some reason the game still doesn't boot up, visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/R5Reloaded) and ask us in the `#questions` channel.
