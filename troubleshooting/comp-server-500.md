# Failed to reach comp-server

If you are trying to broadcast a server to the server browser yourself but you get `Failed to reach comp-server xxx` here are some of the solutions we have right now:

| Error | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| 500 | To host a server, you need to port forward. |
| 400 | If you change your remote scripts it won't allow you to host.  Redownload scripts from the official repo and try again. |
| 500, 400 | Only Latin letters, numbers and spaces are allowed in the server name.  Anything else isn't allowed and will throw you this error. |

In the next update, it's gonna be easier to identify what's the problem.   
In the meantime, if you still can't get this fixed, visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/R5Reloaded) and ask in the `#questions` channel.
