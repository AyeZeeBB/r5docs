# Could not load bank digest file audio\ship\general.mbnk\_digest

In this case, the audio folder is missing or was corrupted. You can check if the file even exists, but most likely it won't.

Try extracting the build again in the same place as your game directory and replace every file. If this problem still persists you should redownload the season 3 build with another method, to make sure nothing else is corrupted.

If you are still having problems, feel free to ask us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/R5Reloaded).
